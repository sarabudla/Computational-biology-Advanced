## Overview
This R Markdown script, "cancerGenomics.Rmd," is a comprehensive guide to analyzing and visualizing cancer genomics data using the maftools package in R. The script covers various aspects of working with Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) files, including reading and summarizing MAF files, visualization techniques, statistical analysis, and more.

## Table of Contents
* 		Reading and summarizing MAF files
* 		Visualization
* 		Analysis
## Sections

**1. Reading and Summarizing MAF files**
* This section explains the process of reading MAF files and provides insights into the necessary input files, including clinical data. It introduces the read.maf function and describes how to create an MAF object.
**2. Visualization**
* In this section, you'll find information about visualizing MAF data. It includes details about creating MAF summary plots, oncoplots, transition and transversion plots, lollipop plots for amino acid changes, rainfall plots, comparing mutation load against TCGA cohorts, and plotting variant allele frequencies.
**3. Analysis**
* The analysis section delves into various analyses you can perform with MAF data. It covers somatic interactions, identifying cancer driver genes, adding and summarizing Pfam domains, conducting survival analysis, comparing two cohorts, clinical enrichment analysis, examining drug-gene interactions, and exploring oncogenic signaling pathways.
* 
Each section provides an in-depth explanation of the relevant concepts and showcases the R code used in the analysis. This script serves as a comprehensive guide to cancer genomics analysis and offers a step-by-step approach to working with MAF files using the maftools package in R.
